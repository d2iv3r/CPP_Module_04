# C++ Module: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

## Overview

In this module, we explore three key concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP): **Subtype Polymorphism**, **Abstract Classes**, and **Interfaces**. These concepts allow us to write more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code by enabling multiple forms of objects to be treated uniformly. Understanding how to leverage these features in C++ is crucial for building scalable and modular systems. 

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Subtype Polymorphism**
- Introduction to **polymorphism** and the concept of subtype polymorphism (also known as **runtime polymorphism**).
- How **virtual functions** enable subtype polymorphism in C++.
- The role of the **base class pointer or reference** to refer to objects of derived classes.
- **Dynamic dispatch** and the importance of the `virtual` keyword.
- How polymorphism can be used to write generic code that works with a variety of object types.

### 2. **Abstract Classes**
- What **abstract classes** are and their role in C++ OOP.
- A class becomes abstract when it has at least one **pure virtual function** (a function with no implementation in the base class).
- The syntax for defining abstract classes and pure virtual functions using the `= 0` syntax.
- How abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly but can serve as a base class for derived classes that implement the pure virtual functions.
- Using abstract classes to define common interfaces that derived classes can implement.

### 3. **Interfaces**
- Understanding **interfaces** in C++ (a class with only pure virtual functions).
- How interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to, without dictating any implementation.
- Using interfaces to enforce consistent behavior across different classes.
- Differences between interfaces and abstract classes in C++.
